// About pMsg...
// (Normally) when you send a cheque to someone, you encrypt it inside an
// envelope, and that
// envelope is attached to a OTMessage (sendUserInstrument) and sent to the
// server. The server
// takes your entire OTMessage and attaches it to an instrumentNotice
// (OTTransaction) which is
// added to the recipient's Nymbox.
// In that case, just pass the pointer to the incoming message here as pMsg, and
// the OT Server
// will attach it as described.
// But let's say you are paying a dividend. The server can't just attach your
// dividend request in
// that case. Normally the recipient's cheque is already in the request. But
// with a dividend, there
// could be a thousand recipients, and their individual vouchers are only
// generated and sent AFTER
// the server receives the "pay dividend" request.
// Therefore in that case, nullptr would be passed for pMsg, meaning that inside
// this function we have
// to generate our own OTMessage "from the server" instead of "from the sender".
// After all, the server's
// private key is the only signer we have in here. And the recipient will be
// expecting to have to
// open a message, so we must create one to give him. So if pMsg is nullptr,
// then
// this function will
// create a message "from the server", containing the instrument, and drop it
// into the recipient's nymbox
// as though it were some incoming message from a normal user.
// This message, in the case of payDividend, should be an "@payDividend"
// message, "from" the server
// and "to" the recipient. The payment instrument must be attached to that new
// message, and therefore it
// must be passed into this function.
// Of course, if pMsg was not nullptr, that means the message (and instrument
// inside of it) already exist,
// so no instrument would need to be passed. But if pMsg IS nullptr, that means
// the
// msg must be generated,
// and thus the instrument MUST be passed in, so that that can be done.
// Therefore the instrument will sometimes be passed in, and sometimes not.
// Therefore the instrument must
// be passed as a pointer.
//
// Conclusion: if pMsg is passed in, then pass a null instrument. (Since the
// instrument is already on pMsg.)
//                (And since the instrument defaults to nullptr, this makes pMsg
// the final argument in the call.)
//         but if pMsg is nullptr, then you must pass the payment instrument as
// the
// next argument. (So pMsg can be created with it.)
// Note: you cannot pass BOTH, or the instrument will simply be ignored, since
// it's already assumed to be in pMsg.
// You might ask: what about the original request then, doesn't the recipient
// get a copy of that? Well, maybe we
// pass it in here and attach it to the new message. Or maybe we just set it as
// the voucher memo.
