    // payment plan) is stored in the ATTACHMENT on the OTItem member.
    //          3. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION is stored in the NOTE field of the
    // OTItem member.
    //
    // Unfortunately, marketReceipt doesn't adhere to this convention, as it
    // stores the Updated Cron Item (the trade) in
    // the note instead of the attachment, and it stores the updated Offer (the
    // additional info) in the attachment instead
    // of the note.
    // Perhaps this is for the best -- it will certainly kick out any accidental
    // confusions between marketReceipt and finalReceipt!
    // todo: switch marketReceipt over to be like finalReceipt as described in
    // this paragraph.

    // be able to count on a Cron Item being in the Transaction Item's
    // Attachment! We can load it using the existing factory class,
