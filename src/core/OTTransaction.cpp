        // stored here in the transaction.)
        //
        // 1.
        // Therefore we must assume that the CALLER OF THIS FUNCTION knows.

        // this, and he SPECIFICALLY called HarvestOpeningNumber() ANYWAY,

        // (when normally he would only recoup the closed numbers--therefore
        // he MUST know that the message
        // failed and that the number is thus still good!)
        //
        // 2.
        // WHEREAS if the message SUCCEEDED (followed by transaction FAIL),
        // then the payer/sender already
        // used his opening number, whereas the recipient DID NOT! Again,
        // the caller MUST KNOW THIS ALREADY.
        // The caller wouldn't call "HarvestOpeningNumber" for a burned
        // number (of the sender.) Therefore
        // he must be calling it to recoup the (still issued) opening number
        // of the RECIPIENT.
        //
        // Problems:
        // 1. What if caller is stupid, and message hasn't actually failed?
        // What if caller is mistakenly
        //    trying to recoup numbers that are actually burned already?
        // Well, the opening number is already
        //    marked as "used but still issued" so when I try to claw it
        // back, that will work (because it
        //    only adds a number BACK after it can confirm that the number
        // WAS issued to me in the first place,
        //    and in this case, that verification will succeed.)
        //    THEREFORE: need to explicitly pass the message's
        // success/failure status into the current
        //    function. IF the msg was a failure, the transaction never had
        // a chance to run and thus the
        //    opening number is still good, and we can claw it back. But if
        // the message was a SUCCESS, then
        //    the transaction definitely TRIED to run, which means the
        // opening number is now burned. (IF
        //    the transaction itself failed, that is. Otherwise if it
        // succeeded, then it's possible, in the
        //    cases of transfer and marketOffer, that the opening number is
        // STILL "used but issued", until
        //    you finally close out your transferReceipt or the finalReceipt
        // for your market offer.)
        //
        // 2. What if caller is stupid, and he called HarvestOpeningNumber
        // for the sender, even though the
        //    number was already burned in the original attempt? (Which we
        // know it was, since the message
        //    itself succeeded.) The sender, of course, has that number on
        // his "issued" list, so his clawback
        //    will succeed, putting him out of sync.
        //
        // 3. What if the recipient is passed into this function? His
        // "opening number" is not the primary
        //    one, but rather, there are three "closing numbers" on a
        // payment plan. One for the sender, to
        //    match his normal opening number, and 2 more for the recipient
        // (an opening and closing number).
        //    Therefore in the case of the recipient, need to grab HIS
        // opening number, not the sender's.
        //    (Therefore need to know whether Nym is sender or recipient.)
        // Is that actually true? Or won't
        //    the harvest process be smart enough to figure that out
        // already? And will it know that the
        //    recipient still needs to harvest HIS opening number, even if
        // the transaction was attempted,
        //    since the recipient's number wasn't marked as "used" unless
        // the transaction itself succeeded.
        //    NOTE: CronItem/Agreement/PaymentPlan is definitely smart
        // enough already to know if the Nym is
        //    the sender or recipient. It will only grab the appropriate
        // number for the right Nym. But here
        //    in THIS function we still have to be smart enough not to call
        // it for the SENDER if the transaction
        //    was attempted (because it must be burned already), but TO call
        // it for the sender if the transaction
        //    was not even attempted (meaning it wasn't burned yet.)

    // -- Verify the transaction numbers on the nym match those exactly on the

    //    The new inbox is still valid, and the new account balance is still

    //
    // Wow ! OTItem::VerifyBalanceStatement will have useful code but it doesn't

    // serves to make sure
    // everything still matches.

    // -- Verify nym transactions match. (issued.)
    // -- Verify outbox matches.

    // from the receipt,
    //    for all those that would actually change the balance (chequeReceipt,
    // marketReceipt, paymentReceipt, basketReceipt.)
    //    These should ALL be found in the current version of the inbox. (They
    // can only be removed by balance agreement,
    //    which would update THIS RECEIPT to remove them...)
    // -- That was the receipt. Now loop through the above inbox items and do
    // the reverse: for each item in the NEW inbox,
    //    add up the total of those that would change the balance, for receipts
    // found on the new but not the old, and account for that exactly as a

     Example.

     -- Oldest signed receipt shows a balance of 115 clams.
        But then, cheque #78 hits my inbox and though I haven't yet accepted the
     receipt, I still need to do a transaction, like a 5 clam withdrawal, or
     whatever,
        and somehow I end up doing a balance agreement.  That results in the
     below signed receipt:

     --- Old receipt shows inbox/account/nym as:
     Currently signed out: 8, 9, 10, and 15
     Balance of 100 clams (Last signed balance before this was for 115 clams
     above)
     Inbox items:
     #78 cheque receipt (#8) for 15 clams. (The missing money is already
     reflected in the above balance. BUT!! #8 must still be signed out for this
     to verify. Here I must sign to acknowledge the receipt is in my inbox, but
     I still have option to accept or dispute the receipt. Until then, server
     keeps it around since it has my signature on it and proves the current
     balance.)
     #82 incoming transfer for 50 clams (A new balance agreement occurs during
     acceptance of this. And the number doesn't belong to me. So, irrelevant
     here.)
     #10 transfer receipt for some old transfer (does NOT change balance, which
     already happened in the past, BUT!! #10 must still be signed out for this
     to verify.)

     My nym ISSUED list should not change unless I have a new transaction
     agreement, therefore I expect the list to match every time.
     My outbox should also match. Thus, only my account balance and inbox might
     change. (On the server side, which I'll see when I dl
     new versions of them and compare against my last receipt i.e. this
     function.)
     How?  NOT via transfer receipt, since I would sign a new balance agreement
     whenever that would actually impact my balance.
     But it could happen with a *** chequeReceipt, a paymentReceipt,
     marketReceipt, or basketReceipt. ***
     Those mean, my balance has changed.
     In those cases, my account balance WOULD be different, but there had better
     be matching receipts in the inbox!

     --- New inbox/account/nym shows:
     Currently signed out: 8, 9, 10, and 15
     Balance of 89 clams
     Inbox items:
     #78 cheque receipt (#8) for 15 clams.
     #82 incoming transfer for 50 clams (A new balance agreement occurs during
     acceptance. So this type has no affect on balance here.)
     #10 transfer receipt for some old transfer (does NOT change balance, which
     already happened in the past)
     #96 cheque receipt for 7 clams (cheque #9)
     #97 marketReceipt for 4 clams (marketOffer #15)
     #99 incoming transfer for 2000 clams (Accepting it will require a new
     balance agreement.)

     ---------------------------------

     How do I interpret all this data?
     -- Transaction numbers signed out had better match. (If #s issued had
     changed, I would have signed for it already.)

     Next loop through the inbox from the old receipt:
     -- #78, cheque receipt, had better be there in the new inbox, since
     removing it requires a balance agreement, meaning it would already be off
     the receipt that I'm verifying... Since it's here in inbox, should
     therefore also be in the last receipt.
     -- #82, incoming transfer from old receipt, had better be also on the new
     inbox, since I could only accept or reject it with a balance agreement,
     which I'm comparing the inbox to now.
     -- #10 had also better be there in the new inbox for the same reason: if I
     had accepted this transfer receipt, then my last balance receipt would
     reflect that.
     -- THEREFORE: ALL items from old receipt must be found inside new inbox!

     Next, loop through the new version of the inbox:
     -- #78, though found in the new inbox, wouldn't necessarily be expected to
     be found in the last receipt, since someone may have cashed my cheque since
     the receipt was made.
     -- #82, though found in the new inbox, wouldn't necessarily be expected to
     be found in the last receipt, since someone may have sent me the transfer
     since receipt was made.
     -- #10 in new inbox, same thing: Someone may have recently accepted my
     transfer, and thus #10 only would have popped in since the last agreement.
     (It was there before, but I couldn't EXPECT that in every case.)
     -- #96 and #97 represent balance CHANGES totalling -11 clams. They must
     correspond to a change in balance.
     -- #96 is a cheque receipt.. it has changed the balance and I must account
     for that. But #78 is ALSO a cheque receipt, so why am I not accounting for
     ITs total (instead just assuming it's accounted for already in the prior
     balance, like 78?) Because it's NEW and wasn't on the old receipt like 78
     is!
     -- Due to the reasoning explained on the above line, ANY chequeReceipt,
     paymentReceipt, marketReceipt, or basketReceipt
        found on the new version of the inbox but NOT on the old one from the
     receipt, must be accounted for against the balance.
     -- #99 is an incoming transfer, but it will not change the balance until
     that transfer is accepted with a new balance agreement sometime in the
     future.
